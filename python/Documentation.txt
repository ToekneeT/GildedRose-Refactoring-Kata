Found the wording a tad confusing in the requirements doc; however, adding a few more days in the texttest_fixture.py
has shown what the correct interaction cases the items.

Noticed that the Conjured items are not working properly. Quality drops by one instead of the required 2.
That is until the sell in is less than 0, by which the quality starts to drop by 2.
 - To solve this, I wrote a unit test that would seemingly work with a conjured item.
 - As expected, when the quality was 5, running the test would result in 4 instead of 3.
 - To add the correct functionality, I split the name into pieces using the string split method. If the first piece was
 "Conjured" it would reduce quality by 2.
 - From there, I tried to add it into the update_quality function and would run the unit test when I thought it was
 working.
 - What I found when running the unit test was that suddenly, the quality dropped from 5 to 2.
 - The issue came from me trying to continue with the current style of arrow code and used the conditional before
 another which led to it reducing the quality by 2 and then another 1. Easy fix.

 With the conjured items now working properly, the next step seems to be refactoring the code and making sure the unit
 tests still work properly as the code is changed.
